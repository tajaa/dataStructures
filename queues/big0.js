//Big O of Queues

// Insertion: O(1);
// Removal: O(1);
// Searching: O(N);
// Access: O(N);

//when we use arrays its not constant time using built in array
//methods because cascade of re-indexing and thats O(N)

//stacks and queues--add things in and remove them
//but both should be constant time O(1)

//Queues

// 1. First in first out data structure, all elements
//2. Queues are useufl for processing tasks and are foundational
//for more complex data structures and algorithms \
//3. Insertion and removal NEEDS to be O(1)otherwise its just a waste
