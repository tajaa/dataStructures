// Tree Traversal
// * How do we visit every node just one time
// * If its not a binary search tree, its not sorted and in order to know if any given number is in the tree, we have to visit every node once
// * Two ways to traverse a tree:
//     * Breadth-first
//         * Start at beginning and work across the tree first
//         * Breadth refers to the width
//     * Depth-first-search
//         * Go down the tree and then coming back up
//             * In order
//             * Pre Order
//             * Post Order
//     * Thereâ€™s not one just solution to print out a tree
